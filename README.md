# This project was created for the [BeeLikeCoders 2.0](https://beelikecoders-2023.devpost.com/) Hackathon by Prabesh Bista and myself. We secured the **runner-up** position.

# Inspiration
Our inspiration to build this app was our personal experience with counseling services and lack of peer support at our educational institution. As international students studying in a small liberal arts college, it is very hard for us to adjust to our surroundings. Our fellow international students have often communicated to us how they lack emotional support and feel like they lack a sense of belonging. Furthermore, we have found that several students have had an unsatisfactory experience with counseling services due to lack of diversity amongst available professionals. Students have also raised their concerns about not having enough community events or group activities that focus on improving their physical health.

# What it does
To address the concerns above, we created WellnessWings: a mobile application that allows students to take charge of their mental and physical health and well being. WellnessWings matches students to licensed professionals based on their gender, pronouns, ethnicity, religion and more, should they choose to disclose these. However, WellnessWings is not just any ordinary mental health app because it also allows students to find activities around them and peers to do those activities with through the help of a chatroom. These activities focus on improving the mental and physical health of students and examples of such include meditation, yoga, gymming, nature walks and healthy-eating dates amongst others.

# How we built it
The current project is a prototype of the app created using Figma. We used the prototyping tools, community resources such as riddle UI icons and other plugins.

# Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we had to face while creating this app was the limited time that was available to us. We initially aimed to code a fully functional app. However, due to the timeline of the hackathon, we chose to create a prototype instead. We look forward to building this application from scratch over the next few months.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our user interface and user experience design, particularly as we did our best to make it as simple and easy to navigate for the user as possible.

# What we learned
One of the most important things we learnt during this hackathon was to manage our time as neither of us have ever competed in a hackathon that was this short. We also learned how to improve our user experience and user interface design skills and were given a chance to enhance our skills in Figma.

# What's next for WellnessWings
The next step in our journey to give wings to our fellow peers is to code the application using Kotlin and/or Swift. In its initial version, the app will have limited functionality in terms of the features outlined in our prototype but with time we hope to make it a fully functional application, as shown in the prototype for both iOS and Android.
We plan to conduct market research by asking students at different institutions about their experiences with counseling services, events and peer support at their educational institution. Based on the data we gather and the conclusions we draw, we will sell our product to universities who can then provide it to their students for free.
